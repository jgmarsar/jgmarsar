- 👋 Hi, I’m @jgmarsar
- 👀 I’m interested in climate, gaming, music, electrical engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python by developing a web scraper to help with my job hunt
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on pretty much anything to practice C, C++, and Python, or a cool FPGA application with VHDL/verilog
